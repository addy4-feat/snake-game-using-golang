# Game options

The fun thing about the snake game i made is that my game also has an options panel!

In here you can change your difficulty and the color of the snake and arenaborder! Of course if you dont want to go in the options screen all of time
you can just go with the standard settings

**Default settings**

- Difficulty: Normal
- Color snake: White
- Color arena: White

## Demo 

This is a demo where i show how the panel works
