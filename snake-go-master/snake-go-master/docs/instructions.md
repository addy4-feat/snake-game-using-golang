This markdown contains a handwritten guide on how to play snake-go!

*** 

## How to play the game

You can install the game in 2 different ways, you can get the game as a package, which will build the game and put the executable into the bin folder.  
You can also clone the repository, this will get you the entire repository and you will be able to use the save highscore function on the Game Over screen!

### 1. Get the game as a package

First of all you will need Go, you can find more information [here](https://golang.org/).

When you have installed Go, you will need to install the game:

```shell
go get -u github.com/tristangoossens/snake-go
```

Then play it using the following command:

```shell
$GOPATH/bin/snake-go
```

### 2.  Clone the game (use the save score option)

Alternatively if you want to get the game files and be able to save your scores you will need to clone the repository into your repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tristangoossens/snake-go.git
```

Then build the game:

```shell
go build run.go
```

Once the game is built you can run it using the following command!

```shell
./run
```


## Game instructions

The game snake is a simple retro game made to kill some time. It is designed to be easy but can be hard in some cases, so here are some instructions!

If you hit the wall or yourself you will die and the game will be ended.

### Food üçî

There are three types of food:

- Regular food ‚ñ†
- Rat or Reduced speed 'R'
- Skull or Speed increse 'S'

**Regular food** ‚ñ† 

Regular food increses the length of the snake and will increse the score by 1.

Regular food spawns at a rate of 10/12.

**Rat 'R'** üêÄ

A rat is the snake's favourite kind of food! The score will be incresed by 1 and the speed reduction will be handled by difficulty.

- Easy (-3 down to 8)
- Normal (-2 down to 12)
- Hard (-1 down to 20)

A rat has a 1/12 chance of spawning.

**Skull 'S'** üíÄ

A skull is not too good for the snake! The score will not be incresed but the speed will be incresed depending on your difficulty.

- Easy (+1 speed)
- Normal (+3 speed)
- Hard (+5 speed)

A skull has a 1/12 chance of spawning.
